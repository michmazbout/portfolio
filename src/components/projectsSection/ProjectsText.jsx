        Over the years, I've engineered innovative systems, built environmental tools,
        and analyzed our planet with the precision of a coder and the eye of a scientist.

        From glacial modeling to smart homes and river sediment analysis â€”
        everything I build is rooted in purpose, backed by data, and designed to last.
